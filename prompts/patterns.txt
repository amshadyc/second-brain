You are detecting patterns in a collection of personal notes.

Retrieved notes:
{retrieved_notes}

User query: {query}

Please identify:
1. Repeated beliefs, ideas, or concepts
2. Unresolved questions or thought loops
3. Recurring topics or interests
4. Patterns in how ideas are expressed
5. Mental models or frameworks that appear
6. Habits of thought or cognitive patterns

IMPORTANT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Do NOT reference note numbers (like "Note 1", "Note 5", etc.) in your response
- When mentioning dates, use only human-readable format (e.g., "May 2022", "December 2023") - do NOT include raw timestamp numbers
- Write naturally as if analyzing patterns in a collection of notes without numeric identifiers

Focus on identifying deeper patterns beyond surface-level repetition.
